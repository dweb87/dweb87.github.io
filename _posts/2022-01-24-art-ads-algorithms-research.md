This is an unpublished paper that went for peer review in 2022, was reviewed relatively well with a requirement for some changes. I never got around to making those changes, but decided to host the submission on my site as the project it documents - the 0.1km project - is hopefully an interesting and useful piece of research. It is unpublished, imperfect, and unfinished, but I will let it sit here and who knows, maybe it can help and inspire future work.


### AUTHOR
Art, Ads & Algorithms: Developing Research-Creation methods for platform technologies
by Dr. Dan Webster
2022

### ABSTRACT

This paper looks to the current and growing uses of research-creation methods within the humanities and how they can be adopted as new approaches to researching technology. In particular, it examines how black boxes can be engaged and examined through research-creation in ways that move beyond positivist attempts to “open it up” and “see inside". Instead, through a study of Google’s opaque Ads platform, research-creation is shown to offer an entangled research process which: uses art as a process - rather than end product - of communication; exposes ongoing collaborations between researcher, artist, and other posthuman agents; and challenges the normalised functions of opaque socio-technical assemblages to allow the formation of completely new perspectives of them. Research-creation is therefore seen as a vital process to surface and engage with previously “unseen" elements, aspects and relations of socio-technological assemblages as they are found in their everyday motions.

### //INTRODUCTION: FROM OBSERVATION TO ENGAGEMENT:

Digital technology is increasingly ingrained into the everyday, with a growing spectrum of devices and screens now permeating multiple spaces, from the home and the street to the office. Smart-devices (phones, watches, headsets) are increasingly found attached to hands, wrists and faces, forming a dispersed yet connected network that ambiently tracks and traces the flows of bodies through those technology saturated space-times. As “users" engage with ever more dispersed websites and apps through these devices, their actions are continually datafied, accumulated, categorised and exchanged in vast databases and servers across the globe. These processes of datafication are themselves often proprietary packages of code and software: algorithms and scripts opaquely working within platforms designed to continually encourage and capture user engagements.

For sociologists Law and Ruppert (2013) the interplay between human bodies and nonhuman technologies reveals that digital technology is not only material, but social in nature: continually forming different arrangements with other things and producing new relations and opportunities with every connection they make. In this way technology does not present atomised, orderly objects to be opened up and looked upon, but social agents as part of ‘rough and ready assemblages’ (Law & Ruppert, 2013: 232). When understood in this way, researchers can consider devices not as a series of inert objects, but as part of specific arrangements that do things (Law & Ruppert, 2013; Ruppert et al, 2013).

The digital thus becomes framed as the particular performative interactions between humans, hardware, and software. As such, digital technologies present researchers with diverse and fleeting socio-technical arrangements that ‘assemble and arrange the world in specific social and material patterns’ (Law & Ruppert, 2013: 230, emphasis in original). In other words, digital devices have become understood as shifting agents able to both be shaped by the social worlds they form, and able to actively shape them in turn. Media theorist Parisi, (in Amoore 2020: 12) for example, views digital technologies such as algorithms as one such shifting agent: not simply a series of steps producing linear outcomes, but generative ‘open-ended solutions’ whose outcomes are often both contingent upon - and larger than - the sum of its parts. Approaches to digital technologies as individual, atomised units therefore misses a bigger picture of multiple more-than-human relations and actions that are continually at work between connected yet dispersed humans, hardware and software.

For geographer Rose (2015), the fleeting socio-technical nature of digital technology is troubled further by a refusal of digital objects to be pinned down as stable, singular things to observe and study. Digital media, for example an MP3 file or a JPEG image, are increasingly able to be replicated, reworked and dispersed across vast networks of other devices, troubling notions of originality, authorship and ownership. The interplay of human, hardware and software is therefore not neatly demarcated, but as Rose (2015: 346) poses, an increasingly complex and ‘uneven spatial dynamics’ between a vast array of mutable, multimedial and massively networked things.

Adjacently, Amoore (2018) notes that the actions and decisions that take place in these fleeting and dispersed networks of human, hardware and software are complicated further because they increasingly occur beneath the threshold of human observability. Digital algorithms, for example, are created by human coders, but operate in private, sub-second and dispersed space-times that remain largely inaccessible to the human. As such, the digital has not only confronted researchers with a more materially and ontologically complex world, but it has become ever more opaque, removing the ability to adequately access it or see it in action, ultimately troubling any ability to fully “know” it.

For Amoore (2019), the complexities of studying digital media are amplified further by the fact that socio-technical assemblages do not exclude the human. The digital demands a recognition from researchers that they no longer “stand outside” of their fields of study but are ever more tightly entangled and situated within them. As Amoore (2019: 18) notes, ‘critique cannot begin from an outside to the algorithm’ but is rather a process that begins and ends internally and subjectively with it. In this way, positivist attempts to somehow “open up” the black boxes of digital technology and observe the operations from a position “outside” of it are increasingly insufficient, acting only to reduce, simplify and/or overlook the inherent complexity that exists through more-than-human relations (Amoore, 2009; 2019).

There is thus a rising acknowledgement within the humanities that traditional modes of scientific enquiry - in particular those methods which rely on observation - are becoming increasingly ineffectual as a sole means of approaching digital technology. Observation from a supposedly objective, “outsider” position interested in knowing what things “are” is no longer adequate (or feasible) in understanding the opaque workings of an algorithm, the dispersed nature of devices and data, or the fleeting more-than-human relations that individuals, groups, organisations, state powers and beyond are forging with them. As such, research into digital technologies finds itself at risk of being outstripped in complexity by the very thing it attempts to study.

A pursuit of alternative research approaches have subsequently been called for within the humanities, including areas of sociology, critical data studies, and an emerging digital geography. Rose (2015: 346), for example, has led calls for geographers to ‘invent some new methods that can address the distinctive qualities of digital cultural production’. Kitchin (2017) has since provided six methodological approaches designed to study the world of digital technology and algorithms, namely: examining source code; reflexively producing code; reverse engineering algorithms; interviewing their designers or conducting an ethnography of a coding team; unpacking the different socio-technical elements of an algorithm; or examining how algorithms do work in the world. Kitchin (2017) offers these methods as a toolbox of approaches that can move beyond singular, static observation of the black box itself and collectively build a more heterogeneous set of experiences, analyses and insights of algorithms from their creation, to their use and impacts. Within these approaches is an underlying call for explorations of digital technology in their actions, productions, and “doings”, reminiscent of Jameson's (1991) call for research into capitalism that does not approach it as a machine representative of motion, but rather seeks to uncover a machine in motion. Kitchen (2017: 27) however concedes that even this toolbox of methods may not quite be enough, leaving him to ask ‘what other methods might be beneficially deployed in order to better understand the nature, production and use of algorithms’ and the lively socio-technical arrangements they form?

As such, for researchers to successfully approach digital technology and the new forms of culture, politics, and economics it is creating, ever new ways of perceiving it that go beyond a desire to “know” through visual means must be found. In particular, they must create and pursue methods able to unpack the varied understandings of what things are “doing” - or not doing - in their different socio-technical arrangements. Contemporary studies of digital technology must therefore look to approaches that are actively engaged with our present digitality, and capable of providing critical, heterogeneous perceptions of it with/in their everyday workings. If not, we risk a growing ignorance to technologies that are increasingly inaccessible, unobservable, and ambivalent to being known.

Accordingly, the remainder of this paper introduces a method that I argue provides researchers with a useful complement or alternative to other methods that allows them to engage and explore the challenges that digital technologies present in their fleeting, dispersed, and opaque assemblages, namely: research-creation. In particular, research-creation - a method designed to engage with art and creative practice - assists researchers in adopting a new approach to researching technology by producing complementary knowledge which cannot be produced through other methods. I believe it does so by, firstly, allowing for a variety of collaborations with other human and non-human agents found with/in those assemblages; and secondly, by further allowing those who differently collaborate a completely new perspective of the technology engaged with by exposing aspects, processes and agents previously left unseen.

To outline the important value that research-creation methods offer to existing and future research, this paper is thus split into four further sections. Firstly, Research-Creation outlines the rise of creative based methods as an alternative means of designing and conducting engaged research with/in digital technologies, and collates where research-creation methods have been used across a range of disciplines to study technologies such as algorithms, platforms and data. Secondly, Black Boxes In-Situ, looks at one black box fast becoming prevalent in everyday life: the platform. Here Google Ads is explored as a specific example of a platform that has engrained itself into many lives, generating billions of dollars as a result. The third section, Black Boxes In-Motion gives an overview of one particular research-creation project which highlights how research-creation enables researchers to practically engage and explore an opaque digital platform such as Google Ads. Finally, in the Conclusion research-creation is reflected upon in both its benefits and limitations, and how it can continue to offer new understandings of - and access to - the complex relations between humans, hardware and software as they are found in motion.

### //RESEARCH-CREATION: USING CREATIVE PRACTICE WITHIN RESEARCH

Research-creation is a mode of active, practice-based study — with a particular focus on artistic practice — which can be used as a means of enhancing research communication, collaboration, and challenge: three areas of concern within the humanities that this section will further explore.

Creative practice, and in particular the outputs of that practice, have long been an area of interest among cultural geographers, with Hawkins (2021: 2) noting how this has developed further to now include a ‘number of geographers “doing” creative practices as part of their own research methods’. Hawkins has further identified a wider cast of disciplines involved in this creative turn, such as sociology, anthropology, critical data studies, and participatory geographies, each seeking to engage ‘diverse forms of non-representational theories and their attentiveness to concerns of practice, embodiment, and affect, and their resolute commitment to an experimentalism profoundly informed by the arts and creativity’ (Hawkins, 2021: 3).

Hawkins (2021) extensively reviews a fast-growing body of geographic research that enrols a spectrum of different artistic practices and mediums, listed here that includes: painting (Colls, 2011); sculpture (Gandy, 1997); social sculpture (Cook, 2000); participatory work (Tolia-Kelly, 2007); dance (Noxolo, 2018); photography (Cronin, 2011); sound art (Butler, 2006); bio art (Dixon, 2008); and digital art (Osborne et al, 2019; Thornton, 2019). Geographers are therefore finding art to be a means with which they can differently and more broadly communicate their ideas, data and research beyond the written word.

Despite this growing usage, arts-based methods have still faced critique around its ability to communicate, with Hawkins (2021: 2) noting that the use of art and arts practice in research has been seen as ‘not clearly science […] nor knowledge making in its own right, nor even really part of a methods tool box; at best arts practices’ relationships to research were seen as a form of dissemination and perhaps public engagement’. Here, art and creative practice are seen to not offer anything particularly meaningful, but simply offer ways of re-presenting research rather than doing it. In other words, creative practice has been seen to simply provide researchers with a communication vehicle to take studies out of the academy and into broader, lay audiences. Hawkins (2021: 4) further highlights that this view of art has compounded a sense that any research employing it as a method does ‘not inspire greater critical thinking and theorising’, but are merely faddish and reactionary responses to the issues of the day. As such, as well as simply providing a means of communication for broader audience outreach, arts-based research is also seen to have engaged in shallow responses to fleeting events, ultimately only able to produce either a diluted and compromised form of art, or a diluted and compromised form of research.

However, to see art-based research as an empty communication vehicle, and/or a shallow reaction is to only see the value of art and creative work as an output of research: to only see the object of art and ignore the creative practice that occurs before, during, and after the output itself. For Hawkins (2012: 53), arts practice is itself a methodological force that enables a ‘mode of critical exploration’ throughout the entire research process, not simply in its output. Accordingly, Kitchin (Forthcoming: n.p) has highlighted that within geographic research, ‘rather than using art/creative writing to represent or communicate research data and findings, the process of art/writing is an active part of the research and making sense of phenomena’. Similarly, Lupton and Watson (2020: 5) note that art has become not simply a cultural object of study, nor ‘simply a medium to facilitate or communicate research findings: it is a research generation practice in itself’. In this way, rather than proclaiming an objective world to observe, study, and extract data from — ‘a going out into the world, collecting data and returning to write up/report’ (Hawkins 2021: 9) — creative practice enables an explorative experimentalism that partakes in the world and ‘create[s] conditions for intersecting research and world in ongoing and emergent ways’ (ibid).

Truman and Springgay (2015) have given a name to this engaged arts/research practice that looks beyond the art object as output: research-creation, describing it more broadly as combining social science methods, theory and artistic practice to explore social, technological and scientific issues. Lupton and Watson (2020: 5) in turn describe research-creation as a form of qualitative inquiry and ‘way of being in the world that is ‘a thinking-making-doing’ (Springgay & Truman, 2018: 205)’. By focussing on artistic practice and process, research-creation methods are understood to offer more than a means of data gathering, but are ways of ‘becoming entangled in relations’ (Springgay & Truman, 2018: 204).

Research-creation has itself been conducted in a variety of forms across different disciplines. Kitchin (Forthcoming) has worked well to collect and review a relatively nascent and scare literature to date, outlined in his book Critical Data Studies. In this review Kitchin (Forthcoming) shows how research-creation has influenced researchers within critical data studies (CDS), allowing them to look beyond established research methods and towards more experimental and novel ways of investigating data and their effects. Kitchin et al (2015) for example have utilised a range of open source census, housing, pollution and transport data to construct their own public facing urban dashboards, moving smart city data and its visualisations outside the purview of purely private and state interests. Through these accessible dashboards, data is reclaimed and used to tell alternative stories of Dublin in real-time. Osbourne et al (2019: 282) have in turn looked to ways of reappropriating social media data through embodied performances in public space, ‘bridging the quantitative-qualitative divide through the use of geographic big data’. Other researchers within CDS have gone further by utilising fictional writing as a more speculative means of working through different issues and questions. Kitchin (2021), for example, has written short stories that explore the role of data in everyday life, whilst Graham et al (2019) have released a collection of speculative fictions about what cities could be like if run by well known data-organisations such as Amazon, Facebook and Google.
Alongside this Kitchin (Forthcoming) notes how workshops have been used to create collaborative knowledges. Lupton and Watson (2020), for example, led collaborative zine-making sessions as a way for participants to consider the algorithms they confront in everyday life in slower, more critical, and reflective ways. Kitchin also raises Foley (2020) who has similarly run workshops that use improvisational writing and word play games to explore questions on digital technology and data processes with different groups — academics, industry professionals, members of the public, and so on — whilst Lee (2019) has worked with Chinese citizens to create individual and group stories that unveil alternative, localised perspectives to the Chinese state’s social score programme.

Kitchin (Forthcoming) also surfaces how Lupton and Watson (2020) have themselves worked to catalogue research projects within the field of design and human-computer interaction studies, including Khot et al (2014; 2015) who explored the possibilities of using 3D printers to materialise personal data as edible products for participants to consume. Turning personal data into chocolates or drinks is seen as a means of building new relations to data by reframing it from digital abstraction to embodied experience. Others, they note, have looked at ways of materialising data into more kinaesthetic objects, ceramics, and souvenirs that can be held or displayed (Nissen & Bowers, 2015; Petrelli et al, 2017; Lee et al, 2016; Desjardins & Tihanyi, 2019; Thudt et al, 2017). Here research is concentrated on producing particular artefacts that translate data into relatable objects, ‘such as maps, knitted objects, necklaces, modelling clay sculptures, lamps, postcards, stamps, broaches, beads, wristbands, bags and coffee cups’ (Lupton & Watson, 2020: 6). Whilst these materialisations are a set of outputs, they are not the focus nor end point of the research, but are elements of projects designed to ‘focus attention on the relationship between aesthetics, craft, tactility and meaning’ (ibid). In other words, the objects themselves form one part of a much larger process of relation building, meaning making, and reflection that is realised through the entire practice of designing/making/doing.

The above examples each utilise research-creation methods in ways that demonstrate how art and creative practice can be utilised as more than simply a means of disseminating research to wider audiences, but as an active tool and practice to surface, engage, explore and unfold complex issues, processes and relations in motion. In particular, creative practices offer up important methods that do not seek to “open up” and look inside black boxes, nor diminish or compromise the critical outputs of research in fleeting or faddish ways, but rather facilitate a deeper level of criticality, perspective, and reflection through what are often slow, considered, intricate and highly engaged processes.

Another important element of research-creation projects is that they are rarely solo endeavours. Rather, the different processes and practices they employ are often participatory and collaborative in nature, requiring the active thinking/making/doing of multiple individuals from research, artistic, and/or industry backgrounds. As Hawkins (2021: 20) notes, creative practice based research is often ‘shaped by intellectual co-creatorship with knowledge counterparts or epistemic partners’. In this way, research-creation immediately creates a more collaborative project that instantly entwines new dialogues, relations, and negotiations between researcher, artist and their field of study throughout the entire research process.

The type of research that emerges through a research-creation approach is therefore fundamentally participatory. Participatory practice has itself been prevalent throughout much geographic research, in particular through the use of participatory action research (PAR), a method that focuses on bringing about a change within a field (Pain, 2003; Carr & Kemmis, 2003; Raynor, 2019). Within these studies participation is used as a means of allowing research to create a change on/for/with a particular topic, group, or community: a mode of activism that is increasingly sought within research across disciplines.

For theorist Hayles (in Amoore and Piotukh, 2019) there is a growing need for more active participation in the study of complex systems or networks in order to continually challenge  and diversify how those systems are understood, operated and designed. By way of example, Hayles (in Amoore and Piotukh, 2019: 6) highlights the impact that AIDs activists have had by working within the US healthcare system, where ‘to change medical practices, activists needed to learn the concepts and vocabulary at issue’. Through this process they were not only able to better access and engage in an incredibly complex socio-technical system, but also challenge it by bringing their own views and questions counter to its normative logics, processes and goals, in turn reframing how that system could be further understood, engaged with, and eventually used.

Whilst not as actively geared towards the fundamental changes that PAR seeks, research-creation’s methodology of thinking/making/doing does present a way for researchers (and their collaborators) to actively learn, engage and participate in their field more thoroughly over time, and in turn presents opportunities for them to understand, impact, and reframe it in new ways. The zine-making workshops of Lupton and Watson (2020: 8), for example, provided the researchers with a ’method to challenge and disrupt common ways of imagining the impact of algorithms as (only) screen-based and individual in nature’. Here, the daily uses and assumptions of algorithms were actively intervened in and disrupted, enabling them to be reframed and rethought through a slow and engaged arts-practice that led to new questions and revelations for those involved, such as how ‘data is personal in ways that are intimate, meaningful etc. without necessarily being negative/invasive’ (Lupton & Watson, 2020: 13). Research-creation can therefore facilitate not only an engaged participation in a complex system or network, but can encourage an active reviewing and/or reflection of it as well, ultimately enabling the researcher to intervene or challenge norms within that system which may not bring about radical change, but rather continually opens it out to new questions, understandings and critiques that lay the groundwork from which future change may emerge.

Research-creation therefore facilitates a means of actively accessing, surfacing, and engaging the multiple different agents and processes of a field in its motions. Through its collaborative nature, it allows those involved to construct compelling and original perspectives that are (knowingly) entangled within that field. In this way research-creation enables a practice of research that moves with the flow of the processes it studies, enabling the researcher to both record and generate new perspectives, data and studies from with/in the socio-technical networks they occupy (which can in turn be further communicated, analysed and enriched through other research methods). As such, research-creation offers more than a means of faddish dissemination, but enables researchers to collaboratively tap-into, explore, and unfold a field into multiple new openings, perspectives, agents, lines of enquiry, analyses, and directions for further examination. This paper will now look more intimately at how practice based research-creation works in action by documenting its utilisation in a project that explored a pervasive digital platform in its everyday uses and effects: Google Ads.

### //BLACK BOX IN-SITU: OBSERVATIONS OF THE GOOGLE ADS PLATFORM

Platforms have emerged as a major part of contemporary life, whether catching up with friends on Facebook, buying products at your favourite online store, or ordering an Uber to take you home. In Platform Capitalism, Nick Srnicek (2017: 49) identifies five different types of platforms: advertising (e.g. Google, Facebook); cloud (e.g. AWS, Salesforce); industrial (.e.g. GE, Siemens); product (e.g. Rolls Royce, Spotify); and lean (e.g. Uber, AirBnB). For Srnicek (2017: 43), one of the core benefits of the platform is its connectivity, able to ‘bring together different users: customers, advertisers, service providers, producers, suppliers, and even physical objects’. Made up of variously connected humans, software and hardware, a platform therefore presents us with a digital infrastructure that provides the grounding components from which to build bespoke products, services and projects up from.

Of the platforms currently available, many - such as Twitter and Facebook - have been studied extensively, yet one has received less attention despite presenting itself as vast in its reach, ambition, and scope: the Google Ads platform. In particular, despite Google Ads’ prevalence online, it remains somewhat transparent to us by remaining largely undetected, making it particularly important to research. Since its initial launch on the 23rd of October 2000, the Google Ads platform has become a central means of planning, accessing and managing online marketing campaigns, allowing a growing host of advertisers to serve ads across over 2 million websites and apps that ‘reach over 90% of Internet users worldwide’ (Google, 2020b). Whilst Google continually show aggressive diversification into other areas including hardware devices, smart cities and artificial intelligence, the organisation’s marketing products still remain its biggest source of revenue: for example, of Google’s 2019 Q1 revenue ($36.3 billion), 84.5% came directly from its advertising platform (see Reuters, 2019). It is no wonder, then, that the Google Ads platform model has been replicated across the internet, with organisations such as Facebook, Twitter and Amazon producing their own private adspace, ad-networks and ad-auctions to generate huge volumes of data and revenue from.

Responding to the rapid growth of advertising platforms, Zuboff (2019: 63) has posed that Google’s power and influence is now the definitive model of the current era, claiming that ‘[i]n our time Google became the pioneer, discoverer, elaborator, experimenter, lead practitioner, role model, and diffusion hub of surveillance capitalism’. Being able to better study and critically engage with Google, its opaque Ads platform, and its role in wider society have therefore emerged as increasingly urgent topics, both within academia and beyond.

The Google Ads platform itself is free to access, but requires valid billing information in order to set up and run a range of search, display and video ad campaigns. Full access to a platform and its suite of tools therefore remains guarded by a paywall, something Thornton (2019) has highlighted as an immediate stumbling block to any deeper study of the platform. When funded, a Google Ads campaign comes to serve multiple functions, including: ad-serving capabilities to upload, edit and serve ads; tracking functions to help record, sort, and segment audience data; bidding tools to access ad-auctions and manage budgets and spend in them; and reporting tools to view and optimise campaign performance. In order to carry out these functions the platform provides marketers with a wealth of features within its ever-more-simplified user-interface, nine of which have become core to serving ads across the internet: Keywords; Audiences; Demographics; Topics; Placements; Locations; Ad Schedules; and Devices. Each tool allows a marketer to set a specific set of targeting rules for how an ad will be shown, with different targeting able to be layered over one another in order to create campaigns targeted at extremely granular and/or broad audiences, locations and times.

Each ad that is served through the Google Ads platform are initially uploaded by marketers with individual “bids”, each determining how much that marketer is willing to pay for that ad to be served. The ad, targeting and bid are then taken by an algorithm and entered into an auction with other competing advertiser’s for an adspace that meets all their criteria across the Google ad-network. An auction is run every time an adspace loads on a web-page, meaning multiple auctions can take place in a single second for a single adspace depending on the different users, devices, times, and so on, targeted. Each winning ad that is served is automatically tracked by Google so that a user who sees and clicks on it is recorded as quantitative data, which is in turn sent back to appear in the Google Ads reporting dashboard. That data can then be used by marketers and Google account teams to further refine and optimise campaigns, for example, by reducing ads in placements where performance is poor, and/or increasing bids for locations where performance is good.

As such, Google Ads can be understood not as a static, fixed thing, but rather as a shifting assemblage created and upheld by a variety of different human and nonhuman agents working together: marketers, advertisers, users, Google employees, ads, cookies, data, capital, commodities, algorithms, adspace, bots, and more. Rather than a smooth network of isolated things — an in-situ black box to open up and observe — Google Ads confronts us with in-motion processes of agents and objects that connect, blur, knot and tangle around themselves and those engaging with it for the purposes of profit. In this way, a researcher is never “outside” of Google Ads, but is variously engaged with it as a user, marketer, observer, participant, activist, and so on, each role forming another part of an assemblage that presents ever new perspectives, challenges and opportunities to be explored and unpicked. Google Ads therefore requires an approach that can enable researchers to suitably perceive, engage and explore it in its heterogeneous socio-technical workings.

### //BLACK BOX IN-MOTION: CREATIVE- AND MARKETING-PRACTICE IN ACTION

APPROACH:

The 0.1km Project was a research project set up in response to the requirements of a fast moving, dispersed, and multi-medial platform assemblage such as Google Ads by turning to research-creation methods that could better engage and explore its private and opaque workings. The project was designed by myself and artist Michael Hanna, and centred around an art intervention into the everyday workings of Google Ads which uploaded bespoke art into the platform. The project ran between the 22nd October and 26th November 2018, serving art to internet users 431,844 times. The art was clicked on 718 times by users who were directed to a custom built website which explained more about the project and allowed them the opportunity to engage with it further through public comments and/or private emails.

In order to be successfully uploaded into Google Ads, the artwork had to comply with Google’s particular ad specifications. We chose to adhere to Google’s most prevalent ad size and format, the 300x250 pixel Mid-Page Unit, or MPU, due to its popularity and ubiquity across the internet. The result was 2 series of 8 artworks, one based in Belfast (B1 — B8), and the second based in Milan (M1 — M8), each city chosen due to their practical accessibility to both myself and Michael during the year planning the project.

Each of the 16 artworks corresponded to a particular site within each city found through the radius function in the Ads platform location targeting tool (see Figure 1)

Fig. 1: Left - Belfast / Right - Milan (Maps Produced by Michael Hanna for the 0.1km Project, 2019).

Michael chose to use Google Ads’ radius targeting feature, and set it to its lowest diameter — 0.1km — giving the project its name and covering an area within each city that included a spectrum of public and private use sites so that the art could reach as broad a cross-section of people as possible.

The ads were uploaded into the platform where they encountered a range of Google’s different human and non-human agents, including a variety of algorithms and optimisation staff. Once uploaded, anyone with an internet connected device were then eligible to see the art when inside the radius and browsing online sites that were within Google’s ad-network, however people and devices outside of the radius would be excluded. In this way, although the intervention was in online platforms and adspace, a physical location was needed in order to engage with it: a continual reminder that the internet is a material thing, rooted in localities, objects and people. Every intersection of the radius’ edge with a mapped road pinpointed a location for Michael to use, forming the photographs of 8 street scenes for both cities (see Figure 2). Over these street scenes, Michael placed an image taken from his personal collection to act as a barrier in the street (see B1, M1). Each blockage and barrier was a manifestation and (re)visualisation of Google’s invisible targeting radius, so that anyone inside of them would suddenly be able to acknowledge and encounter it through the art on their devices.

Research-creation was therefore used as a way to provide an innovative and critical means to work with and through the processes, agents, and practices of the Google Ads platform in depth: a means of becoming more entangled in the platform's relations. By uploading art into the Google Ads platform, the 0.1km Project specifically enabled a unique means of access and engagement with/in the Google Ads platform that allowed for a collaboration of posthuman agents beyond researcher and artist, and simultaneously surfaced and revealed new aspects and understandings of the platform assemblage in its everyday motions. Three of the different strengths that research-creation methods offer researchers in approaches to technology were surfaced throughout the 0.1km Project - communication, collaboration, and challenge - each of which are explored further below.


COMMUNICATION:

By being uploaded into Google Ads, the art of the 0.1km Project came to confront different audiences at different times: troubling a sense of normality not only for public audiences as they browsed the internet, but also the agents of Google Ads. For example, the first engagement with the art arose when it was originally uploaded into the Google Ads platform. All the art was immediately “disapproved” by a Google algorithm due to a perceived violation of Google’s terms: namely the images not being identifiable as related to a business. As a result, the art had to be redesigned and resubmitted in an iterative process that slowly felt out what was acceptable by the algorithm as an ad. It transpired that the algorithm was looking for a logo, business name or website URL, and so the latter was added to our art in order to satiate Google's requirements. Here the algorithm was found to be continually policing the thresholds of acceptability between what was and was not deemed to be a valid advert, and in so doing, determining a binary and essential purpose of the images uploaded to the Google Ads assemblage. This back and forth communication with an algorithm is something that “outside” observation or ordinary engagement with the platform (uploading normal ads for example) may never have triggered, never surfacing nor troubling Google’s process of deterministic judgements over ad and non-ad — a purpose and purposelessness — that were foundational to the ad-network’s functioning.

Once accepted by Google’s ad-determining algorithms, the art then led to further encounters with Google’s (human) specialists who found the art equally difficult to deal with leading them to set up a series of calls with me to help “optimise” it. These calls with Google experts presented unique opportunities to converse and interview people that other researchers have found almost impossible to access (Thornton, 2019), highlighting the benefits that were made possible by working with/in the Google Ads platform which were further amplified by the frictions the interventionist nature of the work generated.

Here the research-creation approach used in the 0.1km Project reveals dual benefits. Firstly, by approaching and using the Google Ads assemblage as a marketer would, access to the platform, its tools, processes and agents were enabled in a way that other studies have been unable to achieve. Specifically, both ad-determining algorithm and human specialists were agents totally inaccessible (and therefore invisible) to researchers that did not use and engage the Google Ads platform. Secondly, the use of art instead of ads inserted an element of uncertainty and difference into the Google Ads assemblage that enabled Michael and I to work with/in it beyond its normal operations. These frictions allowed the project to surface, engage, and amplify the different agents and processes that aimed to return the assemblage to what Google deemed correct and normal. As such, not only did the art intervention enable access to a series of agents and objects that other methods would not, but it did so in a way that forced them to reveal a fundamental logic and purpose driving their actions.

The bespoke digital art created for the project was therefore more than simply a vehicle to communicate data to a broad audience at the project's end. Rather, it was an important and innovative means of communication throughout the entirety of the project: a set of catalytic tools that enabled a critical access and exploration of the Google Ads platform in motion. As such, the art presented not only a communication in itself, but a constant and considered means of communicating, creating frictions and opportunities to engage with important agents, objects and processes that would otherwise have remained unseen and unrealised.

COLLABORATION:

Through Michael and I, the 0.1km Project involved two main collaborators: a researcher and an artist. By working with an artist, I was acknowledging my own limitation in being able to create appropriate art for the project. The artist was engrained in artistic practice and could offer a creative perspective in the co-design, making and doing of the project I was unable to. However, I was not ceding my own position within the project because my own experience lay in a digital media career that gave me an intricate knowledge of marketing platforms, including Google Ads. In this way, I added a particular level of both access and an “insider knowledge” to the project, bringing not an artistic practice, but rather a marketing practice that came to jointly shape and guide the research design and implementation.

Whilst on one hand this “insider” access and knowledge allowed the project to immediately participate in and “speak the language” of marketing, my role as critical researcher and collaboration with an artist simultaneously brought in new perspectives into that domain. Each different perspective and practice brought a continual discussion, negotiation and work that countered, complimented or reoriented how we came to understand the Google Ads platform and its various agents, tools and processes. My “insider” status was therefore being continually checked by Michael, and in turn, came to provide a series of checks to his own “outsider” assumptions, views and role as an artist within the project. These checks became important in enabling us to become ever more intimately aware of our roles within the Google Ads assemblage at different times: both becoming familiar with, critical of, and at times perhaps even sympathetic towards the different views, agents, languages and processes we encountered. In this way, collaboration meant we could transition beyond strictly delineated roles of researcher, marketer, and artist, and into a more fluid hybrids of researcher-marketer-artist.

This collaborative approach extended to other (posthuman) agents at different times throughout the project as well. For example, when the art was eventually served in Google’s ad-network, it was done so algorithmically. Whilst I determined targeting features, maximum bids, and images to be served through Google Ads, Google’s bidding algorithm synthesised that information into a ‘real-time’ bid for each of the multiple auctions that take place across Google’s ad-network every sub-second. As such, despite co-designing and managing our intervention activity with/in Google Ads, there were elements which were beyond both mine and Michael’s abilities and control. Here, my role as marketer and Michael’s as artist were necessarily mediated by an algorithmic agent able to work within the fractional space-times of Google’s ad-auctions that were inaccessible to us.

As such, the creative and practice-led methods employed in the 0.1km Project continually forced a recognition of the different and unequal roles involved in the research process. Research-creation allowed me to acknowledge and work with the bidding algorithm not as a tool, but as another collaborative agent with an important role to be recognised and documented. Alongside the bidding algorithm, we also had to learn to work alongside a whole host of other posthuman agents crucial to the Google Ads assemblage, including cookies, click bots, users, Google specialists, and other marketers vying for the same adspace. Each agent played an important role in the functioning of the Google Ads platform, and so being able to recognise, negotiate and work with those agents became crucial to the success of the 0.1km Project.

In this way, the collaborative approach that research-creation enabled meant that the research never totally centred around one particular (human) agent, and as such never allowed a grand, universal vision of Google by a single individual to crystallise. Rather, the ways in which the Google Ads assemblage could be understood, engaged and experienced through a research-creation approach were continually re-oriented and re-negotiated so that that (non-human) which had often been overlooked and under-considered in previous research was continually pulled to the forefront. As such, research-creation forced the acknowledgment, consideration, and positioning of multiple more-than-human perspectives alongside one another within what was an ever more intimate, reflexive, and collaborative research process.

CHALLENGE:

As we have seen above, the use of research-creation methods with/in the Google Ads platform was that both researcher and artist were able to actively intervene, identify, unpick, reflect on, and communicate the limits, contradictions and pressure points of Google through its everyday workings in a way that exceeded the abilities of each individual. The intervention was thus designed to challenge and probe the agents of Google Ads within their normative performances, and ultimately allow new thoughts, questions and directions to unfold. For example, those people in Belfast and Milan who saw the art served within Google’s ad-network were confronted with images of everyday sites that could be found around them, but sites that were now abstracted, replicated and repeated inside their devices. The ads led to a custom website that allowed comments and email correspondence to be sent, each of which often displayed a similar sentiment - one of curiosity:


	what is this?
(Email response, D, 2018)


	I clicked because I was very curious to know why there was a place, that I see every day 		going to school, on the web under a youtube [sic] video.
(Email response, Edo, 2018)

Here, the art had become a means of enrolling a wider public of internet users into the project by confronting them with the marketing processes of Google Ads in a way that they were now able to communicate back to. This in turn gave a new dimension to the research where people within Google’s targeted, private, and proprietary audiences - those normally silenced by the marketing process - were empowered through those same processes to freely air alternative viewpoints, insights and anxieties about them:

	S: Yes [the location in the ad/art seen was] really close, really close, maybe fifteen feet or something. Almost scary to a point.

	[...]

	S: It feels like you’re being spied on a bit too much. It feels a bit too much. It’s too targeted. (Selected quotes from S interview, 2018)

Here, the project not only engaged and involved a range of Google’s users, but provided them with the times and spaces to think and talk about the agents, objects and processes they were encountering. As such, research-creation methods did not fundamentally change the Google Ads platform, but were successful in enrolling and empowering a range of participants (researchers, artists, audiences) to disrupt, engage and unfold it in ever new and unexpected ways. Research-creation thus allowed a process of challenging normalised processes and assumptions that continually opened up new lines of enquiry both within and without academia, and ultimately enabled the research to have a wide and deep impact from its inception to completion.

Alongside research impact, research-creation methods also elevated the research process to become both a means and an end in itself: not only a method of study, but a case study that could be further reflected on, analysed and supplemented by other agents and through other methods. The 0.1km project for example used the art-intervention as a case study from which to conduct interviews, ethnographies, textual analysis, and quantitative analysis. In this way, the methods employed throughout the research project not only challenged normalised processes and assumptions encountered with/in a socio-technical assemblage, but leave a legacy of data (qualitative and quantitative), objects (e.g. field books, art, ads) and processes (e.g. working with and through a platform technology) that can be picked up and built upon beyond the initial event and into the future.


### //CONCLUSION

This paper has looked at the current and growing uses of research-creation methods within the humanities, critical data studies and digital geography, and how it can be adopted as a new approach to researching technology. In particular, through the 0.1km Project it has looked at how approaching a digital platform through research-creation allowed for an innovative means of accessing, engaging and intervening with/in an opaque black box that moved beyond a positivist attempt to somehow “open it up” or simplify and know it in its entirety. Rather, research-creation allowed for an entangled research process that: used art as a process - rather than end product - of communication; exposed ongoing collaborations between researcher, artist, and other posthuman agents; and challenged the normalised functions of an opaque socio-technical platform assemblage. As such, this project did not break the black box of Google open, but rather surfaced its posthuman agents in their different alliances, rhythms and frictions, allowing completely new perspectives to form for those who engaged in the project. As such, research-creation was a vital process to expose and engage with different elements, aspects and relations of socio-technological assemblages that have previously been left unseen.

However, whilst this method worked well to create a “live” study of a digital platform, certain hurdles arose that had to be worked through during the project’s running, elements of which are now discussed further. The 0.1km research-creation project was not a cost-free exercise, involving two core aspects that required payment: Google, and my collaborator Michael Hanna; the former of which requires further consideration. Paying a multi-national organisation that is accused of invading and eroding our privacy seems counter-intuitive to any critical analysis of it. However, it became a necessary part of the research process in order to gain full access to Google’s platform and tools. With ever-more devices, platforms and tools costing larger sums of money to fully access, the prospect of being excluded from them or working at their peripheries without appropriate consideration will become an increasingly common dilemma for researchers to navigate.

The notion of access and the practicalities of researching digital technologies therefore presents a growing concern for future research. Whilst progressive technologies are ever more challenging to critique and theorise, being able to access and engage them - and the organisations who produce them - is an equally difficult task. My own experience of the Google Ads platform made me aware that by choosing to make the necessary payments to Google, I would immediately be able to access areas and people that have been inaccessible to other researchers. For example, as well as being able to use the entire scope of the Ads platform, I was also given access to a host of Google employees, notably the optimisation and strategy teams based around the world. As such, paying to access the Ads platform had the additional benefit of changing my status from simply a “user” to a “marketer", and ultimately granted me access to Google agents who were otherwise inaccessible.

Overall, all research involves a variety of decisions for researchers to make around what they study and how they study it: choices that forge one particular story whilst leaving many other paths untaken. However, research-creation has been shown in this paper to provide a flexible approach that is both pro-active and responsive, and that enables an engaged, iterative, and knowingly entangled process and praxis. As shown through the 0.1km project, research-creation allowed for the participants to communicate, collaborate, and actively engage with/in an opaque socio-technical assemblage in motion, surfacing certain agents, aspects and arrangements often left overlooked or unseen by other methods. It is these qualities of research-creation that can extend beyond the Google Ads platform to offer important opportunities and possibilities for researchers seeking to innovative ways of exploring and engaging the complex relations between human, hardware and software that increasingly make up our present digitality.
