Thursday the 18th February 2021 is a day that will be fresh in my mind for a long time. At 11am I began my viva voce, the spoken defence of my PhD thesis "Beyond the Click: Interventions in Digital AdSpace".

The exam took over two hours, on zoom, with each passing minute leaving me feeling it was getting progressively worse as the criticism started to stack up.

It got to the end and they sent me off whilst they had a chat to determine their final decision. I went to the kitchen and had the longest, most anxious few minutes of my life, making a tea I didn't even want.

When I came back on, I was told that I had passed, and with only minor corrections. That moment broke me as I had been expecting a far worse decision.

### Reflections

It is now two days after the viva, and I can start to have a bit more of a clear head on the whole thing. In hindsight, I can already see that it didn't go as bad as I felt it was going at the time. My expectations and anxiety got the better of me in the moment, and I should have had more faith in my own abilities because I actually spoke very well. My work was praised for its excellence, and I have been encouraged to publish it. These are dream comments for me, and I can see that rather than trying to tear my work apart, my examiners were actually helping me to armour plate my own work from scrutiny when I come to try and get it published.

I think what I realised is to believe more in my own ability, have faith in what I think and say, and to not take criticism to heart, but rather see it for what it most likely is; simply a way to build on and [improve what is there in front of me](https://dweb87.github.io/straw-man-theory/). That is all easier said than done, especially when its a personal project that I spent the last 3 years working on. But when applying it to my other work, it will come into huge use to at least try and remember it from time to time.

I doubt I will ever face anything quite as daunting or challenging as my viva. I spoke with leading experts in my field, and not only held my own but came out of it with the names of a few publishers to submit my work to. From that I take a lot of confidence into what comes next.

### What Comes Next

What comes next for me is still to be fully formed. But I know that I want it to remain centred around producing excellent, world leading, original work. I know I want to continue being able to think deeply about problems and solve them in innovative and novel ways. And I know I want to be able to work flexibly and in an agile, project based manner with custom teams, clients and others who want to push and challenge the way they work towards something truly excellent.

The last few years for me have been spent creating something that has passed the highest scrutiny imaginable, theorising new ways to conceive the relation between humans, devices, algorithms, cookies, auction models, platforms, ads, consent, responsibility, ethics, and more. What I want most in my future is to find others who are thinking through these things, trying to find new solutions to the same old problems, and looking to do so in ways that always push our practice forwards into new creative frontiers. If you think that might be you, feel free to give me a shout :)
