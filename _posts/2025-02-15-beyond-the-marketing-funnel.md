For years, digital marketing has relied on the funnel as the dominant strategic model—guiding consumers step by step from awareness to conversion. It’s a neat and tidy framework that looks great in presentations. But does it truly reflect how people engage with brands?

The reality is far messier. Consumers don’t move in linear paths. They discover, hesitate, return, validate, get distracted, and sometimes convert when we least expect it. The modern customer journey is therefore not a funnel or pipeline, but a web of interconnected behaviours, loops, and triggers. Yet, most strategies still force-fit people into an outdated structure.


### From Funnels to Patterns

Rather than viewing consumer behaviour as a rigid sequence, we should be looking for patterns - the recurring ways people engage with brands, make decisions, and form habits. Some patterns are organic, shaped by cultural shifts and digital ecosystems. Others can be designed and reinforced by brands to guide users toward meaningful engagement.

Engagement is a two way thing (think Serre's Parasite that takes and gives). Successful brands don’t just react to consumer behaviour - they actively help to shape it through the media, content, sites, and products they put into the world. They create desires, rituals, habits, and systems that engage people long before and after a purchase. The real challenge is understanding how to identify, amplify, and build these patterns - both consumer's and brand's - into marketing strategy.


### What Comes Next?

Moving beyond the funnel means rethinking how we segment audiences: not by who they are, but by how they behave; how we create engagement loops; and how brands can develop their own patterns to reinforce consumer action.

In upcoming pieces, we’ll explore:

i) Mapping Consumer Behaviour as Patterns – How to track and visualise behaviours beyond traditional customer journeys.

ii) The Role of Triggers and Loops in Brand Engagement – Understanding the psychological and contextual forces that shape consumer actions.

iii) Designing Behaviours Rather than Just Tracking Them – How brands can intentionally shape consumer engagement rather than just reacting to it.

It’s time to move past the funnel and into a more dynamic, behaviour-first model.
