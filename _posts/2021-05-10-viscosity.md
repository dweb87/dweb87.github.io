After now finishing my PhD thesis and on the cusp of being able to finally submit it in hardbound form, I wanted to post a few snippets that may be of use in wider applications - both in relation to digital marketing and beyond. My thesis comprised of many different things, but structurally was centred around 6 analysis chapters that individually looked at a particular aspect of digital marketing and began to construct a new vocabulary with which to approach, understand, and unfold it.

Over the coming months I will be drip feeding in some of these terms, none of which are absolute, but rather seeds from which others may branch into new directions. The first term outlined below is one that has been used elsewhere (Tim Morton for example), however I apply it more directly to data, and specifically how I perceive data's current form in its use with/in digital platform technologies.

### Viscosity

 When we think of data it is often  terms that are fluid or liquid in nature: data "flows" in "streams" or feeds; it is the new "oil"; it is transported through "pipelines". When it arrives at its destination however, it seems to somehow solidify into profiles, accounts, data doubles and so on. In contemporary thought data is therefore both solid and liquid, but never at the same time; rather it inhabits the opposite poles of a binary. This binary of course provides us with useful ways think about data, but only ever in one dimension.

 Instead of continuing this binary thinking towards data as variously liquid or solid, we could instead find an in-between language that would enable us to conceive of data as something simultaneously liquid and solid. As such, I use the term viscosity to perform such a role, allowing the liquidity and solidity of data to both be carried forward at the same time.

Viscosity itself comprises of particular forms: stickiness; elasticity; and thickness. Each characteristic perform a role in describing and accounting for how data is able to be attached to - yet removed from - an individual, how it is both captured and capturing, how it coheres disparate entities (human, hardware, software) together, how it can continually assimilate and leak beyond its initial means in ways that link and deepen, and how it can open agents/users up to various other data, platforms, agents and processes.

In this way, viscosity brings a more complex way to think about data in its everyday uses, and in particular how it comes to cling to users whilst also being very removed from them. It is through this type of in-between thinking (what queer theorist Jack Gieseking terms "useful in/stability") that other terms in my thesis began to take shape and build a wider vocabulary that I hope will be of use to others when attempting to describe, analyse and account for digital media and marketing both now and into the future.
