### Why Location Targeting Feels More Precise Than It Actually Is

Location targeting is often presented as one of digital marketing’s most concrete capabilities. Unlike interests or demographics, location feels grounded: someone is *here*, not *there*. Platforms encourage this sense of certainty by offering neat boundaries such as postcodes, radii, store visits, “people who live in this area.” For marketers, location appears to be one of the few signals that reliably connects online activity to the physical world.

But in practice, location targeting rarely behaves as cleanly as this framing suggests. People appear in places they don’t remember visiting, campaigns over- or under-deliver without clear geographic logic, and footfall metrics fluctuate in ways that resist explanation. Marketers are often told this is a data quality issue (GPS drift, privacy thresholds, device settings, etc) but these explanations don’t fully account for how strange and inconsistent location data can be.

The deeper problem is that location is usually treated as a *fact* rather than a *process*. Platforms tend to present location as something detected and recorded: a point on a map captured by a device. This encourages the idea that space is stable and external, and that the job of technology is simply to measure it more accurately. When this measurement fails, the assumption is that the system needs refinement.

However, digital advertising systems don’t just observe location, they *produce* it. A “location” is assembled from multiple signals: device settings, network infrastructure, platform assumptions, advertiser goals, and statistical thresholds designed to protect privacy and maintain scale. What counts as being “in” a place is constantly recalculated, negotiated, and approximated rather than precisely known.

Holding on to the idea that location targeting should be exact leads marketers to misread what’s happening. Variability gets interpreted as error, and uncertainty as failure. More importantly, it reinforces the belief that platforms offer a stable spatial truth about people’s movements: a belief that underpins both overconfidence in targeting and anxiety about surveillance.

To understand why location targeting behaves the way it does, we need to stop thinking of space as fixed and start thinking about how platforms *perform* location. That shift changes what precision means, how responsibility is distributed, and what marketers should reasonably expect from location-based campaigns.
