Hi, my name is Dan Webster.

I am a consultant specialising in digital media and marketing strategy, and have just undertaken a PhD looking into areas of algorithms, ad-networks and posthuman marketing techniques. What all that means is precisely what this blog will be about, with each post looking to unpick elements of past, present and future marketing processes.

You can [learn more about my background here](https://dweb87.github.io/about), but tldr: its been a bit of a mixed bag, traversing both academia and industry in pursuit of a deeper understanding of the human relation to the digital.

The blog itself has been created through jekyll and is powered by github, which has been a whole new learning process for me. I have no idea how (in)frequent my posting will be, but I hope to use this simply as a platform to: get out ideas; track my thinking on certain topics as it develops over time; and bump into other people and projects with similar interests.
