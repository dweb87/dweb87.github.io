### Beyond Surveillance

The problem with the surveillance capitalism story isn’t that it’s completely wrong, it’s that it assumes digital advertising platforms are trying to achieve certainty and control. In reality, platforms like Google don’t primarily operate by perfectly predicting or shaping individual behaviour. They operate by continuously *producing markets*: unstable, competitive environments where advertisers, users, data, and automated systems are brought into temporary alignment just long enough for value to be extracted.

From this perspective, uncertainty isn’t a failure of the system but rather it is what makes the system work. Volatile prices, shifting audiences, unclear attribution, and inconsistent outcomes are not bugs to be fixed, but features that keep advertisers testing, adjusting, and spending. Platforms don’t need to know users in any deep or stable sense; they only need to keep the market moving, recalculating value moment by moment through auctions, signals, and feedback loops.

This also reframes what targeting actually does. Rather than revealing who people “are”, targeting assembles short-lived opportunities based on what people, devices, and contexts can do at a given moment. Audiences aren’t discovered; they’re performed. They fleetingly exist at the intersection of timing, infrastructure, behaviour, and competition, then dissolve. This is why targeting often feels vague, approximate, and contradictory — because it is designed to be responsive, not precise.

Seen this way, algorithms stop looking like autonomous decision-makers and start looking like coordinators. They don’t decide value from above; they help align advertisers’ bids, users’ actions, available inventory, and platform incentives in real time. Prices emerge from this collective activity, not from hidden knowledge or perfect prediction. What matters is not control, but participation in a constantly adjusting market.

For marketers, this reframing changes the stakes. Success is no longer about uncovering the “right” audience or cracking the algorithm, but about navigating an environment that will always remain partially opaque. Strategy becomes less about prediction and more about interpretation, experimentation, and timing. Metrics become signals to reason with, not truths to obey. Uncertainty stops being something to eliminate and becomes something to work with.

If digital advertising is best understood as a fragile, opportunistic market rather than a surveillance machine, then marketers are not omnipotent manipulators or helpless operators. They are situated agents making consequential moves within systems that never fully settle. That shift **from control to navigation** is what opens up more honest performance evaluation, more grounded ethics, and a more realistic sense of what digital marketing can and cannot do.
