Waking up to the detritus of my life, I strive towards defining a new teleology, a new sense of directions and purpose for myself. A sense of hope. This feels quite far away from me at times, but not ever an impossibility. Having a sense of purpose is something I have always struggled with. I find I am generally O.K at a variety of things, without truly excelling. A jack of all trades rather than a polymath. I am comfortable with this, but it does make things difficult: it is not ever a lack of knowing what I want to do, but rather a lack of knowing if any of them will make me happy, and therefore a lack of dedication to any one thing. This seems even more difficult now that the one thing I was truly dedicated to was abruptly ended without my inout several months ago.

I had been in a relationship for just over 9 years. Out of the blue they came in one day and declared that they had met someone else and were leaving me. Up to that point, I had never even considered this as a possibility. I had found our relationship strong. We didn't fight, very rarely argued. We had just bought a house together, lived through the first two Covid-19 lockdowns, weathered various master's, jobs, a PhD, moving country, and were now returning to work and some sense of normality - whatever that means on today's (post)pandemic context. They had met someone three weeks before. He runs his dad's business. I was devastated. I am devastated.

People keep saying that I am, and must, mourn. Mourn a life I had. So I try. I mourn a life that is gone. But I also mourn futures that were conjured and lived out through breathless laughter and yearning. I mourn a past that is fuzzy, tainted by a desire for clues, signs, cracks. I mourn the agency I thought I had as the life I had ended without my knowledge or consent. To bring that relationship to an end was was more to me than severing a tie, but unsettled my very relation to the past, present, and future.

### Telelogy

Mark Fisher, in his work on hauntology, noted how it presents two directions: one towards the past and that which is no longer; and one towards the future and that which has not yet happened. For Fisher, the general condition of our present era is best understood through hauntology, where time gains a sense of agency and is able to effect/affect us in the present. Its major effect is that the present has seemingly hit an impasse where the future disappears to be replaced only by the continual re-emergence of the past. It can be seen in the way that the present is increasingly hard to define, describe, and represent, forcing people to turn away from the future and instead become stuck in loops of nostalgia for a perceived past. This manifests most obviously in culture where music, fashion, art, film, and media hark back to older eras in attempts to try and understand and regenerate something new in the present.

In this way, hauntology concerns things/forces which act at a distance, a reminder that to haunt does not mean to be present.

For me, hauntology not only describes a crisis in time (and therefore space) - of non-times and non-spaces - but ties into a teleological crisis as well: a loss of purpose and direction. To paraphrase Alan Partridge, society no longer evolves, but revolves. It in those constant tumbles and cycles that the future is lost - the ability to see where we (could) go - but also our ability to define what the point is: what our purpose is and could be.

It is a state of hauntology that I find myself in in my own present. I wake to spectres of a life that no longer exists, that may never have really existed as I understood it anyway, and a person who is no longer here: photos; trinkets; cutlery; furniture; plants; scents; sounds; objects and senses conspiring to subsume me in revolutions of memory and feeling. I wake to a labyrinth of ghosts and spectres that conjure not only a past that refuses to leave, but futures that are no longer possible. It leaves me lost, purposelessness, sometimes hopeless.

### Ablutions

It is therefore my intention to begin the process of redefining my own teleology. Remembering that things like hope, joy, purpose, love, are not innate things, but are processes and relations that require constant work and maintenance, and to be truly successful must be continually redefined and redirected to new contexts of life.

At some point in the future, I will begin abluting myself of my hauntological situation as much as I can. This doesn't mean destroying or burning things, although I do acknowledge that for complete healing, some things may need to burn so I can build anew. Rather, I want to reposition these voids and ghosts in ways that allow me to acknowledge them, confront them anew, and re-relate to them in ways that allow me to exist in the same space with them in new ways.

I plan to do this through different personal projects, each inevitably will stop and start (and stop again), overlap and blur. But each will cover areas that have seemed to crop up in my life - GHOSTS, VOIDS, SILENCES - things that have caused me trouble and worry, and are therefore things that I want to trouble and worry in return.

There is no time frame on these projects. It may begin and never end. It may never really begin. But like horoscopes, tarot, algorithms, they will simply be attempts to divine from myself some sort of order and teleology in the world, documents that start to spell out some sort of logic in the chaos of my present. As with all my work, I will remain open to multiplicity, complexity, contradiction and the lack of a coherent answer, instead knowing that these documents are merely part of the process to surface and develop a sense of something, not the end product/answer/purpose itself.

It is through this work that I hope to find a sense of myself again, a sense of my own purpose, agency and belonging.
