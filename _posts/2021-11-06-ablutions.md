Waking up to the detritus of my life, I strive towards defining a new teleology, a new sense of directions and purpose for myself. A sense of hope. This feels quite far away from me at times, but not ever an impossibility. Having a sense of purpose is something I have always struggled with. I find I am generally O.K at a variety of things, without truly excelling. A jack of all trades rather than a polymath. I am comfortable with this, but it does make things difficult: it is not ever a lack of knowing what I want to do, but rather a lack of knowing if any of them will make me happy, and therefore a lack of dedication to any one thing. This seems even more difficult now that the one thing I was truly dedicated to was abruptly ended without my inout several months ago.

I had been in a relationship with Clare for 9 years. Out of the blue she came in one day and declared that she had met someone else and was leaving me. Up to that point, I had never even considered this as a possibility. Our relationship was strong. We didn't fight, very rarely argued. We had just bought a house together, lived through the first two Covid-19 lockdowns, weathered a PhD and were now returning to work and some sense of normality - whatever that means in the post-covid, post-brexit environment. She had met him three weeks before. He ran his dad's business. I was devastated. I am devastated.

People keep saying that I am, and must, mourn. Mourn a life I had. So I try. I mourn a life that is gone. I mourn futures that were lived out through breathless laughter and yearning. I mourn a past that is fuzzy, tainted by a desire for clues, signs, cracks. I mourn the agency I thought I had as the life I had ended without my knowledge or consent. To bring that relationship to an end was was more to me than severing a tie, but unsettled my very relation to the past, present, and future.

### Telelogy

Mark Fisher, in his work on hauntology, noted how it presents two directions: one towards the past and that which is no longer; and one towards the future and that which has not yet happened. For Fisher, the general condition of our present era is best understood through hauntology, where time gains a psycholanalytic sense of agency and is able to effect/affect us in the present. Its major effect is that the present has seemingly hit an impasse where the future dissappears to be replaced only by the continual re-emergence of the past. It can be seen in the way that the present is increasingly hard to define, describe, and represent, forcing people to instead turn away from the future and innovation, and instead become stuck in loops of nostalgia for the past. This manifests most obviously in culture where music, fashion, art, film, and media hark back to old eras in order to try and understand and regenerate something new in the present.

In this way, hauntology concerns things/forces which act at a distance, a reminder that to haunt does not mean to be present.

For me, hauntology not only describes a crisis in time (and therefore space) - of non-times and non-spaces - but ties into a teleological crisis as well: a loss of purpose and direction. To paraphrase Alan partridge, society no longer evolves, but revolves. It in those constant tumbles and cycles that the future is lost - the ability to see where we (could) go - but also our ability to define what the point is: what our purpose is and could be.

It is a state of hauntology that I find myself in in my own present. I wake to spectres of a life that no longer exists, that may never have really existed as I understood it anyway, and a person who is no longer here: Photos; Trinkets; Cutlery; Funrtinture; Plants; Scents; Sounds; objects and senses conspiring to subsume me in revolutions of memory and feeling. I wake to a labyrinth of ghosts and spectres that conjure not only a past that refuses to leave, but futures that are no longer possible. It leaves me lost, purposelessness, sometimes hopeless.

### Ablutions

It is therefore my intention to begin the process of redefining my own teleology. Remembering that things like hope, joy, purpose, love, are not innate things, but are processes and relations that require constant work and maintenance, and to be truly successful, continual redefining and redirecting.

Into the future, I will begin abluting myself of my hauntological situation as much as I can. This doesn't mean destroying or burning things, although I do acknowledge that for complete healing, some things may need to burn so I can build anew. Rather, I want to reposition these ghosts in ways that allow me to acknowledge them, confront them anew, and re-relate to them in ways that allow me to exist in the same space with them in new ways.

I plan to do this through three documents. Each will be multimedial, zine like structures that allow me to craft and weave memory, thoughts, ideas, exercises and tools into something material and tangible. The three volumes will cover different aspects of my current crisis, and allow me to work them into older parts of my life, and from the disparate parts try and find some sense of order, some patterns to play with, and maybe pull together a new sense of purpose, direction and hope.

The three volumes will cover: GHOSTS; SILENCE; and VOIDS. Each will inevitably overlap and blur, but each cover three areas that have seemed to crop up in my life, things that have cause me trouble and worry, and are therefore things that I want to trouble and worry in return.

There is no time frame on this project. It may begin and never end. But like horoscopes, tarot, algorithms, are attempts to find some sort of order and teleology in the world, these documents are my method at finding some sort of logic in the chaos of my present. As with all my work, I will remain open to multiplicity, complexity, contradiction and the lack of a coherent answer, instead knowing that these documents are merely part of the process to purpose, not the end product/answer itself.

It is through this work that I hope to find a sense of myself again, a sense of my own purpose, agency and belonging.
