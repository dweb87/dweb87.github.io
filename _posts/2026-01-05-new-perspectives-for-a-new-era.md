### OVERVIEW

My PhD thesis (2020) argues that digital advertising platforms (e.g. Google, Meta) do not primarily function as totalising systems of behavioural control but as fragile, performative markets that mobilise human and nonhuman agencies through logistical processes to continually generate profit amid uncertainty.

This shift in understanding gives marketers a new way of understanding of how digital advertising actually functions in the era of AI: replacing myths of cybernetic prediction and optimisation with concepts that explain volatility, misalignment, and emergent value, enabling better strategic judgement.

The following series will present these ideas in blog couplets outlining my ideas in a call and response format: one blog outlining the current perception and the issues that they present marketers with; a second blog that responds to this “issue” with a new perspective that allows us to better work through it. As such, this series will outline less by way of tactics and more in strategic orientation, diagnosis, and judgement - critical skills for an increasingly uncertain world.

TL;DR: This series outlines a cartography of digital advertising platforms that provides new directions for digital marketers in an acceleratingly posthuman era.



### OUTPUTS

## What you’ll get from this series

This series isn’t about “how to hack the algorithm” or optimise your way to certainty. It’s about understanding what digital marketing platforms are *actually doing*, why they behave the way they do, and how that changes how you work with them.

Through the posts, you will get the following:

# 1. A new understanding of how platforms *really* work

You’ll come away with a more realistic mental model of Google Ads and similar platforms: one that explains volatility, inconsistency, and opacity without resorting to myths about total surveillance or perfect optimisation. Rather than assuming platforms precisely “know” users, the series shows how they assemble unstable, temporary market situations that are constantly shifting.

**What this gives you:** better strategic judgement and fewer surprises when results don’t behave as promised.

# 2. A way to interpret performance from and work with the “black box”

If you’ve ever felt that attribution models don’t quite add up, that campaigns stop working for no clear reason, or even that failure feels built into the system, this series explains why. It reframes noise, waste, and inefficiency not as individual failures, but as structural features of digital advertising markets

**What this gives you:** healthier evaluation practices and more confidence in decision-making through uncertainty.


# 3. A more realistic way to think about audiences and targeting

Rather than treating audiences as stable identities defined by clear-cut demographics or interests, the series shows how targeting actually works through momentary actions, contexts, and affordances. This helps explain why overly specific targeting sometimes disappoints and why timing, placement, and adjacency matter more than platforms admit.

**What this gives you:** more realistic targeting strategies and fewer ethical and practical dead ends.


# 4. A renewed sense of agency in your role as a marketer

Finally, this series reframes what it means to work in digital marketing today. Marketers are not omnipotent manipulators, nor powerless button-pushers. You are situated agents navigating uncertain systems, where judgement, interpretation, and care matter more than blind optimisation.

**What this gives you:** permission to trust experience, think critically, and intervene thoughtfully rather than just follow “best practice”.


If you work in digital marketing and have ever felt that the story you’re told about platforms doesn’t quite match the reality you experience day to day, then this series is for you.
