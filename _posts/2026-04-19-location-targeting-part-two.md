### Viscous Space

A more useful way to understand location in digital advertising is to treat it as *viscous* rather than precise. Viscosity describes something that holds together without being rigid, neither fully solid nor fully fluid. Platform locations work in this way: they are stable enough to be actionable, but flexible enough to adapt to infrastructure, competition, and uncertainty.

In this model, location is not a point on a map but a temporary alignment between bodies, devices, networks, and platforms. Being “near a store” or “in an area” is less about exact coordinates and more about whether enough signals cohere to make a marketing action viable. This is why location boundaries stretch, blur, and sometimes contradict themselves; they are designed to remain usable, not exact.

This reframing also explains why location targeting often feels probabilistic. Platforms are not trying to establish where someone *truly* is; they are trying to determine whether a location-based interaction can be made to work at scale. Precision is always balanced against reach, privacy constraints, and commercial demand. Viscosity allows location to travel across devices, contexts, and time without breaking the market.

For marketers, this shifts how location performance should be interpreted. Instead of asking “Was this person really there?”, the more useful question becomes “What kinds of spatial relationships did this campaign make possible?” Location targeting doesn’t reveal movement so much as it creates opportunities for proximity to matter: imperfectly, unevenly, but productively.

This also reframes ethical concerns. Location data is often imagined as a form of invasive tracking, but viscous space distributes agency across many actors and systems. No single party fully controls what location means or how it is used. Responsibility lies not in perfect measurement or total avoidance, but in how spatial signals are activated, combined, and acted upon.

Understanding location as viscous space allows marketers to work with uncertainty rather than against it. It encourages strategies that prioritise context, timing, and adjacency over false precision, and it replaces the fantasy of spatial mastery with a more realistic appreciation of how digital markets actually move through space.
