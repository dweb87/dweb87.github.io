Something I learnt the hard way is the benefit of not striving towards perfection. When given a task by the client with a deliverable required at the end of it, it almost always comes back with amendments, corrections, other bits that the client has suddenly thought would be nice to see, or simply didn't quite get at what they were aiming for - something they only realise when they see the thing in front of them. The same is true for writing a PhD: every chapter I wrote came back with new notes, new ideas to think about, new references to seek out and include.

The reason for this is that usually, with all the best intentions, a brief never really covers what is wanted at the end of it. It may suggest, intimate and/or direct, but usually the main objective is still partially, if not largely, elusive.

As such, I realised that when we have a certain deliverable with a fixed deadline, its not necessarily a good idea to spend a lot of time creating what you think is the final version to hand in on the day. Rather, its far more useful for both you and the client if you create something smaller in the shorter term, something say 60-80% complete that you can then go through with them and get the feedback then and there, teasing out the real issues and aims, and reorientating the original brief so that you can go back and adjust it for the final thing.

I like to think of this as creating a straw man - something you can fling on the table that just gets the conversation started on something tangible, something that can be pulled apart and reconstructed again with what the client - now they have seen something - actually wants.

### Deliverables as Process

This thinking is underpinned by some nice Continental Philosophy (Foucault) that moves us away from thinking about things as essential, whole, sovereign, to instead thinking of things as processes and practices. In this way, a deliverable is never really whole, but is rather a particular point in a continual process always in the making. Of course, in the real world we have deadlines and hard cut off points that something has to be done by, but realistically they are merely a line in the sand of what is a big work in process to allow you to move on to the next thing.

Here it is worth pointing out that this is not a call to do bad work, nor to always resort to a straw man process, but rather an acknowledgement that with every task we can begin to think a bit more strategically and where possible, realign where our energies go. There's no point spending 80% of your time working on something that you think the client wants, but that will likely come back with necessary changes which you only have 20% of your time left to work on. The straw man approach allows us to invert that thinking, spending 20% of our time on something that we can start talking to our clients about and thrashing it out into something more collaborative - and useful.

With this in mind, where I have sufficient rapport with the client, I tend to not be too precious about the deliverables I create an instead I approach them as straw men: each a particular stage in what is an iterative process rather than the pursuit of strict outcomes.
