I attended Google's recent training on re-strategising paid search activity for algorithmic  activity a couple of weeks ago. It was an interesting session, a lot pa led into a single hour that attempted to convince advertisers and marketers of why they should tear up everything Google have previously taught them about running a PPC campaign. However, there was one particular aspect that really jumped out at me: how Google were using the logic of Mark (yes, grandfather of communism Karl Marx). In this article I am going to establish what that link is, and unpick this a bit further to try and tease out why it has come about.

### Resistance to Simplicity

One sticking point that Google and other advertising platforms have faced in recent years is a slow take up - perhaps even resistance to - algorithms and automated campaign management. In my own research, this was for various reasons, but one in particular seemed quietly convincing: it's a resistance to simplicity.

To explain this we must look to how a paid search (or social) account is normally structured. Usually campaigns are structured by some form of segmentation. The most common is match type: a series of campaigns replicated over and over but differentiated by the keyword match type (exact, phrase, broad, and/or broad match modifier). Other splits I have seen are geographical, demographic (ages, genders), and devices (mobile, tablet, desktop). Whatever the segmentation used, they are implemented because they provide a view of how particular segments perform and can be optimised differently at a very immediate and top line level without having to pull lots of different reports. In this way it's ultimately a means of control: allowing the marketer to oversee and action things in a quicker and more efficient manner. As a result, campaigns become quite big, unwieldy even, often reflecting the logic of its creator in how they like to manage an account (by match type, or by device, or by audience, and so on)

### Machinic Anxiety

The arrival of the algorithm however has led to a complete inversion of this logic. No longer should we be making campaigns structured to how we - humans - understand search as working, but rather to a new algorithmic logic. Rather than lots of small campaigns with closely related keywords and ads, Google are now suggesting singular campaigns, adgroups with 100s of keywords, and segmentation made along goals: for example CPA targets. This is a move from the granular to a maximalist logic of the algorithm, whereby it needs a big data set to learn from and a goal to work towards (machine learning).

Essentially, Google are telling marketers to give over some control of their campaigns, and that is scary. Rather than big campaigns with multiple lines of segmentation to offer clients, marketers are being asked to just give them 1 single line that am algorithm runs. As a friend of mine at Facebook said to me, people are not afraid of the algorithm so much as resistant to the simplicity it presents them with.

In particukar, this is scary because tied up in this are all sorts of anxieties, with none more fearsome than the prospect of being replaced by the machine. And this is a genuine fear; supermarkets are replacing their check-out assistants; automated cars are being developed to replace cab drivers; and factory lines are being roboticised, all developments directly replacing what are predominantly working-class jobs.

### Machinic Liberation

During the Google training I was a part of, they immediately worked hard to head these types of anxieties off, framing it in a very particular - and what I thought was Marxist - way. Instead of talking about how the algorithm would take over parts of the work a marketer would normally do - how it takes away from you - they immediately started to talk about how it actually gives marketers back time: time to do things beyond the nitty-gritty of account management. In particular, they claimed it gives you time back to thing and act more strategically, taking in the wider marketing mix and producing plans and campaigns that look beyond simply search keywords.

Generally this is great news, and the correct direction most marketers want to be going in. And it is something I was talking about nearly 5 years ago in one of my annual reviews when I worked at Maxus, and funnily stems from some of Karl Marx's thinking on mechanisation. In his "fragment on the machine" from the Grundrisse, Marx indicates how automation would create surplus time for workers to work less and think more creatively, to produce more creatively, and apply their energies in new productive directions. For Marx, automation enabled a form of liberation from work and the concentration of energies into new creative and productive streams. This is what Google seemed to be intimating: that by taking away the laborious side of the job, their algorithms would not take the job away from marketers, but free them to do other, more creative elements of the job that would increase overall productivity for them, their agency, and their clients.

### The Future

Whilst this all sounds really lovely and utopian - funnily socialist - in its appeal, it will of course come down to how agencies see the application of this. If you have a PPC team of 3 people and an algorithm can do a lot of the grunt work, do you need 3 people to all be doing strategy? Do you need 3 people to all be pulling in different creative directions? My argument would be yes, you do, as those directions are constantly pulling you out of your comfort zone and into new frontiers of creative output and possibilities. Whether that view is shared by al companies is another thing altogether.

That aside, I am intrigued by Google's approach to this, and find it funny that my views form a performance review about how to improve our team and the work it was producing are now being mirrored by Google 5 years later. Whether they have knowingly used Marx's fragment on the machine in their thinking will probably never be known, but the fact that that is where this thinking ultimately lies, is an interesting development, and one that poses many questions for the future of digital marketing. Ultimately though, anything that is able to release individual and group creativity is a good thing. I am just not sure that Google are being totally genuine in their claims that the algorithm as it is currently used in a sometimes ruthless pursuit of profit will be the way to do that.
