I attended Google's recent training on restrategising paid search activity for algorithmic  activity a couple of weeks ago. It was an interesting session, a lot pa led into a single hour that attempted to convince advertisers and marketers of why they should tear up everything Google have previously taught them about running a PPC campaign. However, there was one particular aspect that really jumped out at me: how Google were using the logic of Mark (yes, grandfather of communism Karl Marx). In this article I am going to establish what that link is, and unpick this a bit further to try and tease out why it has come about.

###Machinic Liberation
One sticking point that Google and other advertising platforms have faced in recent years is a slow take up - perhaps even resistance to - algorithms and automated campaign management. In my own research, this was for various reasons, but one in particular seemed quietly convincing: it's a resistance to simplicity.

To explain this we must look to how a paid search (or social) account is normally structured. Usually campaigns are structured by some form of segmentation. The most common is match type: a series of campaigns replicated over and over but differentiated by the keyword match type (exact, phrase, broad, and/or broad match modifier). Other splits I have seen are geographical, demographic (ages, genders), and devices (mobile, tablet, desktop). Whatever the segmentation used, they are implemented because they provide a view of how particular segments perform and can be optimised differently at a very immediate and top line level without having to pull lots of different reports. In this way it's ultimately a means of control: allowing the marketer to oversee and action things in a quicker and more efficient manner. As a result, campaigns become quite big, unwieldy even, often reflecting the logic of its creator in how they like to manage an account (by match type, or by device, or by audience, and so on)

###Resistance to Simplicity
The arrival of the algorithm however has led to a complete inversion of this logic. No longer should we be making campaigns structured to how we - humans - understand search as working, but rather to a new algorithmic logic. Rather than lots of small campaigns with closely related keywords and ads, Google are now suggesting singular campaigns, adgroups with 100s of keywords, and segmentation made along goals: for example CPA targets. This is a move from the granular to a maximalist logic of the algorithm, whereby it needs a big data set to learn from and a goal to work towards (machine learning).

Essentially, Google are telling marketers to give over some control of their campaigns, and that is scary. Rather than big campaigns with multiple lines of segmentation to offer clients, marketers are being asked to just give them 1 single line that am algorithm runs. As a friend of mine at Facebook said to me, people are not afraid of the algorithm so much as resistant to the simplicity it presents them with.

###MAchinic Anxiety
Tied up in this are all sorts of anxieties, but none more fearsome than the prospect of being replaced by the machine.
