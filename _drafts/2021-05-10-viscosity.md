After now finishing my PhD thesis and on the cusp of being able to finally submit it in hardbound form, I wanted to post a few snippets that may be of use in wider applications - both in relation to digital marketing and beyond. My thesis comprised of many different things, but structurally was centred around 6 analysis chapters that individually looked at a particular aspect of digital marketing and began to construct a new vocabulary with which to approach, understand, and unfold it. Over the coming months I will be drip feeding in some of these terms, none of which are absolute, but rather seeds from which others may branch into new directions. The first term outlined below is one that has been used elsewhere, however I apply it more directly to data, and specifically how I perceive data's current form in its use with/in digital platform technologies.

### Viscosity
