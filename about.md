### How I Got Here
I started as a project manager in a digital design agency before moving into performance buying through platforms such as Google Ads, Facebook, and Twitter.

I have pioneered several different methods in areas such as YouTube, Twitter, and Programmatic display buying, and was the first person in the world to serve art in Google's adspace as part of my PhD research. I have worked as a freelancer on small projects, built and led awards winning teams in large agencies, and am always interested in new alliances and partnerships on interesting projects. Google have even written a case study of my work [here](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/_qs/documents/1313/BT_DBM_GAP_Case_Study.pdf).

I am currently thinking about posthuman approaches to digital media and how best to make writing thought pieces on digital culture, trends, and strategies part of my (semi)regular routine.
