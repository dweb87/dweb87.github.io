### How I Got Here
I started as a project manager in a digital design agency before moving into performance buying through platforms such as Google Ads, Facebook, and Twitter.

I have pioneered several different methods in areas such as YouTube, Twitter, and Programmatic display buying, and was the first person in the world to serve art in Google's adspace. I have worked as a freelancer on small projects, built and led awards winning teams, and am always interested in new alliances and partnerships on interesting projects. Google have even written a case study of my work [here](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/_qs/documents/1313/BT_DBM_GAP_Case_Study.pdf).

I am currently thinking about posthuman approaches to digital media, the need for attribution in a post-cookie world, the application of blockchain technologies beyond cryptocurrencies, and how best to keep writing thought pieces on digital culture, trends, and strategies.
